# Elon Musk Simulator

**Elon Musk Simulator** is a tongue-in-cheek browser game where you try to keep Elon's many ventures afloat. Each turn presents a question with absurd proposals. Swipe **left** or **right** to answer and balance the vital stats for SpaceX, Tesla, and other Musk projects. Let any vital reach 0 or 100 and it's game over!

## Playing the Game
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (double click the file or serve it locally).
3. Drag/swipe the card left or right to pick an answer. Keep the meters from maxing out or dropping to zero to survive.
4. If you fail, hit **Try Again** or **Quit** to restart.
